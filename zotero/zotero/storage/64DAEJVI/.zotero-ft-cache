1.10 Remote Repositories

Great job! We've gone ahead and created a new empty GitHub repository for you to use with Try Git at https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git . To push our local repo to the GitHub server we'll need to add a remote repository.

This command takes a remote name and a repository URL , which in your case is https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git .

Go ahead and run git remote add with the options below:

git remote add origin https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git

Advice

git remote: Git doesn't care what you name your remotes, but it's typical to name your main one origin .

It's also a good idea for your main repository to be on a remote server like GitHub in case your machine is lost at sea during a transatlantic boat cruise or crushed by three monkey statues during an earthquake.
