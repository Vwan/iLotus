Live preview with Scroll Sync

StackEdit’s Scroll Sync extension accurately binds the scrollbars of the editor panel and the preview panel to ensure that you always keep an eye on the output while writing.




Built-in spell checking

StackEdit uses browser’s built-in spell-checker to perform efficient, multi-language spell-checking and correction suggestions.
Fully customizable

StackEdit offers infinite combinations of settings. Theme, layout, shortcuts can be personalized. For the rest, StackEdit gives you the freedom to make your own extension…
